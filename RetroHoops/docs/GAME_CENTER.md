# Game Center setup

Game Center in Retro Hoops is **optional and off by default**. The player turns it on in **Settings ▸ Game Center ▸ Sign in**. Without it, the game works exactly the same offline.

## What's in the project

- **Native bridge:** `Assets/Plugins/iOS/CallerGameCenter.mm` (GameKit). It handles sign-in, leaderboard scores, achievements, and the Game Center dashboard.
- **C# service:** `Core/GameCenterService.cs`. `GameKitGameCenterService` is used on iOS builds and `NullGameCenterService` everywhere else (Editor, other platforms).
- **What gets reported:** `Logic/Progression/Daily.cs` ▸ `Achievements` decides which achievements are earned and which scores are reported. It's pure logic and unit-tested.
- **When it reports:** after every rewarded game, the tutorial, practice and party games, and 2 Player games. Nothing is sent unless the player opted in and is signed in.
- **Xcode setup:** the iOS build post-processor links `GameKit.framework` and adds the **Game Center** capability automatically.

## You need to create these in App Store Connect

In App Store Connect, open **App ▸ Features ▸ Game Center**. The IDs must match exactly.

### Leaderboards (Classic)

| Leaderboard ID | Name | Sort | Score format |
|---|---|---|---|
| `retroball.lb.career_wins` | Career Wins | High to low | Integer |
| `retroball.lb.career_greens` | Green Releases | High to low | Integer |
| `retroball.lb.daily_best_streak` | Best Daily Streak | High to low | Integer |
| `retroball.lb.king_streak` | King of the Court Streak | High to low | Integer |
| `retroball.lb.arcade_clears` | Arcade Ladder Clears | High to low | Integer |
| `retroball.lb.shootout_wins` | Shootout Wins | High to low | Integer |
| `retroball.lb.around_world` | Around the World | Low to high | Elapsed time (to the hundredth of a second) |
| `retroball.lb.win_streak` | Best Win Streak | High to low | Integer |

| `retrohoops.live.rating` | Live Rating (best) | High to low | Integer |
| `retrohoops.lb.gauntlet` | Skills Gauntlet (best) | High to low | Integer |

### Leaderboard (Recurring, Phase 33)

| Leaderboard ID | Name | Sort | Score format | Recurrence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `retrohoops.live.monthly` | Live Rating (this month) | High to low | Integer | Starts on the 1st, lasts 1 month, repeats |

In App Store Connect choose **Recurring** (not Classic) for this one. The game posts your Live rating to it only in a month you've played Live, so each month's board shows that month's active players.

"Around the World" scores are sent in hundredths of a second (41.23 s = 4123), which is the format Game Center's "Elapsed time (to the hundredth of a second)" expects. A leaderboard only receives a score once you have one: zeros are never sent.

### Achievements

Achievements report 100% when earned. Points total **1,000** (Game Center allows up to 1,000; no single achievement above 100). This list comes from `Achievements.All` in `Logic/Progression/Daily.cs`, and a unit test checks the limits.

Each achievement needs a title, a pre-earned and an earned description, its points, and a 512×512 or 1024×1024 image. Mark none of them hidden.

## Testing

- **Device or simulator:** Game Center sign-in works on an iPhone or the iOS Simulator with a sandbox Apple Account. In the iPhone's Settings app, go to **Game Center** and sign in.
- **Before submission:** leaderboards and achievements show up only after they're created in App Store Connect and the build uses the same bundle ID.
- **Status:** none of this has been tested on a device yet.

## Privacy

The game sends only scores and achievement progress, and only through Apple's Game Center. App Privacy answers stay **Data Not Collected** for the developer. Confirm this against Apple's current guidance when you submit.
